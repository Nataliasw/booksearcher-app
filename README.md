# Booksearcher App
This web app was built using TypeScript. 
In search bar you can write any word and it will display list of books from New York Times Bestsellers Database with your word in title.

## Example
If your input is `farm` it will display list:

* A Family Place: A Hudson Valley Farm, Three Centuries, Five Wars, One Family (Excelsior Editions)
by Leila Philip

* A Garlic Testament: Seasons on a Small New Mexico Farm
by Stanley Crawford
...and so on.
